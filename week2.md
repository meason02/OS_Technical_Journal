# Security Planning and Testing Methodology

## Introduction:
This task focuses on establishing a security baseline and defining a structured performance testing methodology for the deployed systems. The objective is to design and document a remote monitoring and performance testing approach that ensures the system operates reliably under expected conditions. In addition, this task aims to implement and verify core security configurations, including access control, network protection, and system hardening measures. Finally, a threat model is developed to identify potential security risks and outline appropriate mitigation strategies, ensuring the system remains secure, resilient, and aligned with best practice standards.
