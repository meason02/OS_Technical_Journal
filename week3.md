# Application Selection for Performance Testing

## Introduction:

This journal documents the selection, deployment, and evaluation of applications representing different workload types for performance testing. The objective of this task is to identify suitable applications that generate CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, disk I/O-intensive, network-intensive, and server-based workloads, and to justify their use through an application selection matrix. In addition, this journal records the SSH-based installation process, outlines the expected resource usage for each application, and defines a monitoring strategy to measure system behaviour and performance under each workload scenario.

## Application Selection for Performance Evaluation
For performance evaluation, applications were selected to generate CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and I/O-intensive workloads, as these represent core system resource demands. CPU-intensive applications are used to assess processor utilisation and system responsiveness under heavy computational load. Memory-intensive applications evaluate how efficiently the system manages RAM usage and handles memory allocation under stress. I/O-intensive applications are used to measure disk read and write performance, which is critical for understanding storage behaviour and identifying potential bottlenecks. Testing these workload types provides a clear insight into overall system performance and stability.

## Workload Types and Selected Applications

The selected workload types focus on CPU, memory, and disk I/O stress, as these directly reflect how system resources behave under load. Each workload type was mapped to an appropriate application capable of generating controlled and measurable stress on the target resource. This approach ensures that performance testing is structured and that each application serves a specific evaluation purpose, allowing clear observation of system behaviour without overlap between workload categories.
