# Application Selection for Performance Testing

## Introduction:

This journal documents the selection, deployment, and evaluation of applications representing different workload types for performance testing. The objective of this task is to identify suitable applications that generate CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, disk I/O-intensive, network-intensive, and server-based workloads, and to justify their use through an application selection matrix. In addition, this journal records the SSH-based installation process, outlines the expected resource usage for each application, and defines a monitoring strategy to measure system behaviour and performance under each workload scenario.
