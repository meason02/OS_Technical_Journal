# Application Selection for Performance Testing

## Introduction:

This journal documents the selection, deployment, and evaluation of applications representing different workload types for performance testing. The objective of this task is to identify suitable applications that generate CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, disk I/O-intensive, network-intensive, and server-based workloads, and to justify their use through an application selection matrix. In addition, this journal records the SSH-based installation process, outlines the expected resource usage for each application, and defines a monitoring strategy to measure system behaviour and performance under each workload scenario.

## Application Selection for Performance Evaluation
For performance evaluation, applications were selected to generate CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and I/O-intensive workloads, as these represent core system resource demands. CPU-intensive applications are used to assess processor utilisation and system responsiveness under heavy computational load. Memory-intensive applications evaluate how efficiently the system manages RAM usage and handles memory allocation under stress. I/O-intensive applications are used to measure disk read and write performance, which is critical for understanding storage behaviour and identifying potential bottlenecks. Testing these workload types provides a clear insight into overall system performance and stability.
