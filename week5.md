# Advanced Security and Monitoring Infrastructure

## introduction:
This task focuses on implementing advanced security controls and developing a robust monitoring infrastructure for the server environment. The objectives include configuring access control mechanisms using SELinux or AppArmor to enforce strict security policies, enabling automatic security updates to maintain system integrity, and deploying fail2ban for enhanced intrusion detection. In addition, custom scripts are created to automate verification and monitoring: security-baseline.sh ensures that all security configurations from previous phases are correctly applied, while monitor-server.sh allows remote collection of performance metrics via SSH. Together, these measures establish a secure and auditable environment while enabling continuous system monitoring and performance evaluation.
